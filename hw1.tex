\paragraph{Homework content}
In this homework we will try to answer some essentialy question to be able to write an article about \textit{Build a  parallel Corpora between Algerian Dialect (AD) and Modern Standard Arabic(MSA) for Machine Translation}\footnote{MMH mini-project subject} and publish it. 
\section{Subject Area:}
The field of the project is \textit{Natural Language Processing}(NLP).
\section{Aim:}
Build Corpora for Machine Translation(MT) projects
\section{Arguments:}
Create a Corpora of parrallel AD and MSA for developpers. lack of resources is main arguments and motivation to build the Corpora.
for other regions such as Marroco, Tunisia, Lebanon, Middle-East Regions and Egypt, they have their own Corporas for example MADAR, it contains some of AD but not rich.
\section{Objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Collect as much as possible for parrallel MSA-DA dataset of Algerian dialect.
	\item Filter collected data.	
	\item Organize the dataset depends on location. 
	\item Build a parallel dataset ready for the use for future works.	
	
\end{itemize}
